kbd (1.15.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert the build-dependency change towards gettext:any and let the buildds
    do their work again, closes: #670778.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Apr 2012 09:43:38 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set debian/compat to 9 and build-depend on debhelper >= 9.
  * Support cross-building, closes: #670653.  Thanks to Colin Watson
    <cjwatson@ubuntu.com> for the patch.
    - Allow the gettext build-dep to be satisfied by a package of any
      architecture.
    - Use dh_auto_configure.
    - Explicitly set the host CC to cross-build the contrib binaries.
  * Trigger font setup when any of CONSOLE_FONT, CONSOLE_MAP, or FONT_MAP are
    present in /etc/kbd/config, closes: #647153.
  * Point Format: in debian/copyright to the 1.0 version of the
    machine-readable copyright spec.
  * Update manpages.diff: Minor fixes to the setleds(1) manual page, closes:
    #663252.  Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason <bjarniig@rhi.hi.is> for the
    patch.
  * Provide a no-op “status” option for /etc/init.d/kbd.
  * Bump Standards-Version: to 3.9.3, no changes necessary.

kbd (1.15.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dpkg-buildflags to pass build options on to the configure
    script; build-depend on dpkg-dev >= 1.16.1 accordingly.
  * Set debian/compat to 8 and build-depend on debhelper >= 8.
  * Don’t depend on console-setup | console-common to break up a
    dependency loop.  The default configuration does not require any
    files from console-data (which is pulled in through console-common)
    or console-setup, so this should be a safe change.  Both packages
    are still alternatives in Recommends:.
  * Package relationship cleanup:
    - Drop minimum version from the console-data recommendation (the
      mentioned revision is from 2001).
    - Don’t Breaks:/Replaces: util-linux (relevant revisions before
      early 2001).
    - Don’t conflict with kbd-data, which hasn’t been around since
      Slink.
    - Get rid of all mentions of “open” (from the Slink era too).  This
      name is only provided by console-tools and kbd these days, which
      already conflict via console-utilities.  There also aren’t any
      dependencies on it in the archive.
  * Fix some deviations from DEP 5 in debian/copyright.
  * Rename patch openvt_error_handling to openvt and update it to not
    exit with a zero status code if there was an invocation error,
    closes: #642324.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Sep 2011 22:54:08 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Experimentally drop reset_vga_palette from /etc/init.d/kbd, closes:
    #637277.
  * Build for Architecture: linux-any to help clean up Not-For-Us.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Aug 2011 20:57:00 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move away from topgit: Export the patches to debian/patches/ one
    last time and maintain them with quilt in the future.
  * Use the occasion to make the patch headers more DEP-3-y.
  * Add a manual page for setvtrgb(1) introduced in 1.15.3.
  * debian/copyright: List copyright holders for setvtrgb.c and set
    Format: to the frozen DEP URL.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jul 2011 11:50:09 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove a superfluous call to wait() in openvt.c to propagate the
    exit code of the child process of “openvt -w”, closes: #630108.
  * Write and ship a manual page for the kbdinfo(1) utility introduced with
    1.15.3.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Jun 2011 12:49:42 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules clean: Force regeneration of loadkeys.c and
    loadkeys.analyze.c, closes: #629180, #629191.
  * Manually clean some .gmo files in po/.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Jun 2011 15:28:44 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch loadkeys_stdin, taken from upstream Git: A regression in
    the loadkeys program caused it to read no files at all, rather than
    stdin, when called without arguments.  This broke, for instance, the
    /etc/init.d/kbd script.
  * Point debian/copyright to the frozen revision of DEP 5, which is the
    one now shipped in debian-policy.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Fri, 03 Jun 2011 12:40:56 +0200

kbd (1.15.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Drop the compose_as_usual patch (merged upstream).
    - Includes Dustin Kirkland’s setvtrgb utility, closes: #617416; and
      kbdinfo, vaguely based on Julien Cristau’s VT mode query code,
      closes: #618573.
    - Reflect changes to the build system in debian/rules.
    - Spanish translations had to be dropped due to problems with the
      es.po file.
  * Upgrade Standards-Version to 3.9.2, no changes needed.
  * Point Vcs-* to anonscm.debian.org.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Wed, 25 May 2011 21:48:07 +0200

kbd (1.15.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Priority: to optional (while downgrading console-tools to extra),
    closes: #591146.
  * Change my e-mail address in Uploaders:, debian/copyright and patches.
  * Update debian/copyright format to the current revision of DEP-5.
  * Patch manpages:
    - Document that the -e switch requires openvt to be a session leader,
      closes: #610373.
    - Give in to lintian concerning the *superflous typo in mk_modmap(8).
  * Breaks: util-linux (<< 2.11) instead of conflicting with it, as per Policy
    7.6.1: This was because of kbdrate moving packages.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Feb 2011 11:38:00 +0100

kbd (1.15.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch compose_as_usual: Fix the Unicode conversion of the internal
    “compose as usual” table with “loadkeys -u”, closes: #600006.
  * Prefer console-setup over console-data and console-common.  This is part
    of a d-i related fix and helps avoid that both console-setup-udeb and
    console-data ask the user for their preferred keyboard layout (by simply
    not installing console-data by default).  Thanks to Julien Cristau,
    closes: #606186.
  * Package housekeeping:
    - Upgrade Standards-Version: to 3.9.1, no changes necessary.
    - Package-Type: no longer needs an XC- prefix.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to kbd-udeb as well.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Wed, 08 Dec 2010 00:04:20 +0100

kbd (1.15.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - The vcstime and cast_align patches have been merged.  They are
      removed from the .debian.tar.gz.
    - Drop the install_exec patch; this problem has been fixed in this
      version’s build system.
  * Do not regenerate configure in debian/rules.
  * Minor changes to debian/copyright (most recent DEP 5 draft).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4, no changes needed.
  * Remove the Greek translation in gr.po.  The correct 639-1 code is
    “el”; el.po exists as a more recent version of gr.po.
  * Ship only selected files from the doc/ directory, as most files are
    outdated and useless to the vast majority of users.  Remove
    README.Euro and LISEZMOI.Euro from the debian/ directory.
  * Register the font-formats documentation with doc-base.
  * Convert debian/rules to the more idiomatic format with override_*
    targets and depend on debhelper >= 7.0.50.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Sun, 25 Apr 2010 19:28:19 +0200

kbd (1.15.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch vcstime: /dev/vcs or /dev/vcs0 may act as console memory
    devices.  Before, only the latter file was considered in vcstime, causing
    it to fail on recent systems.
  * Mention the possibility of having vcstime run by kbd.init in
    /etc/kbd/config.
  * kbd.init: Remove some pointless code in the vcstime stanza.
  * kbd.init: The X-Start-Before hack is no longer needed as all init scripts
    with a Should-Start on console-screen have added kbd, closes: #563608.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Sun, 24 Jan 2010 19:50:42 +0100

kbd (1.15.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch cast_align: Fix an FTBFS on some architectures caused by an
    alignment error after casting a (char *) to a (struct psf2_header *) which
    has members aligned to more than a byte, closes: #558492.  The patch has
    been imported from the kbd upstream VCS.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Thu, 03 Dec 2009 19:03:22 +0100

kbd (1.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - The auto_convert, compile_on_sparc, keysyms, and showconsolefont_spaces
      patches have been merged.  They are removed from the .debian.tar.gz.
  * This upload converts the package to the 3.0 (quilt) source format.  The
    build-dependency on quilt, the patch/unpatch logic in debian/rules and
    the debian/README.source file have been removed.
  * kbd.init: If Upstart is used, get TTY information from /etc/init/tty*.conf
    rather than /etc/inittab, closes: #549317.
  * New patch kbd_mode: Change the misleading “default (ASCII) mode” message
    in kbd_mode to the more correct “xlate (8-bit) mode”, closes: #546712.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Tue, 24 Nov 2009 20:55:31 +0100

kbd (1.15-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename the console-screen.kbd.sh init script to kbd and change its LSB
    Provides: header accordingly.  Until scripts from other packages add kbd
    to their {Required,Should}-Start: headers, use the X-Start-Before: feature
    and list reverse dependencies.  This should make it possible to replace
    console-tools by kbd when insserv is installed, closes: #542225, #541161.
  * Remove “.IX” lines from manual pages.  Current versions of groff don’t
    know the syntax they use, and most of them add no valuable information
    whatsoever, so removing them should not be a problem.
  * Restore config.h.in in debian/rules clean.  It is automatically amended
    during the build process.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes needed.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Wed, 09 Sep 2009 19:28:47 +0200

kbd (1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix an (as of yet unreported) regression introduced by the support of the
    composition of two UNUMBERS.
  * console-screen.kbd.sh: Add the X-Interactive LSB header to make sure the
    script runs on a real VT on insserv-assisted init, closes: #538434.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:57:22 +0200

kbd (1.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch (back) to quilt, see debian/README.source.  TopGit is used to
    manage the patches on top of Git.
  * Revert the old read_keymaps_fmt patch to loadkeys/dumpkeys (auto-converts
    between K(KTYP, KVAL) and Unicode keysyms depending on the console mode)
    and replace it with a new one which has been merged upstream.  See #251550
    for an earlier discussion, closes: #524057.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2.
  * Support Unicode compose tables, closes: #524907.
  * Save cat-id-tbl.c, analyze.c, loadkeys.c when building and restore them in
    debian/rules clean.
  * showconsolefont: Print adequate space chars, closes: #528357.  On recent
    kernels a direct-to-font space is needed if the console is in Unicode
    mode.
  * console-screen.kbd.sh: Slightly rephrase evals to avoid quirks in Vim’s
    syntax highlighting.  Remove the “kill -NAL” XSI-ism and replace it with
    “kill -s NAL”.
  * console-screen.kbd.sh: Mention console-setup when font setup is deferred,
    closes: #532139.
  * Update the information regarding hardwired scancode ranges in the
    setkeycodes(8) manpage, closes: #399531.  They don’t exist in recent
    kernels.
  * Replace “-” (hyphen) by “\-” (ASCII minus sign) in some manpages where
    command line options are mentioned.
  * Add support for Brl_dot9 and Brl_dot10, closes: #533065.  These keysyms
    are supported by Linux >= 2.6.23.  Thanks to Samuel Thibault
    <sthibault@debian.org> for the patch.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Fri, 24 Jul 2009 13:00:49 +0200

kbd (1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Adds translations for Danish, French, Swedish and Turkish.
    - Fail cleanly on Unicode keysyms >= 0xf000, closes: #500116.
    - Print an error message when calls to exec* functions fail, closes:
      #190387.  Patch proposed by Ian Jackson, thanks!
    - The historical information formerly found in CREDITS is now found in
      AUTHORS.
  * Change my e-mail address in debian/{control,copyright}.
  * Read /etc/environment sanely, closes: #506318.  Let the shell parse
    the locale configuration files instead of using a grep | tail | cut
    pipeline to avoid reading garbage.  This is the same as #364797 in
    console-tools which was subsequently fixed by the patch proposed in
    #382115.  Thanks to Colin Watson for the idea.
  * Revamp debian/rules to use debhelper 7; change control and compat
    accordingly.
  * Build-depend on flex and bison to generate analyze.c and loadkeys.c from
    analyze.l and loadkeys.y, respectively.
  * kbd_mode(1): Explain the -C option, closes: #508795.
  * Allow all Latin keysyms to be treated as “letter” in the sense of
    keymaps(5), closes: #514908.  Thanks to Frédéric Boiteux
    <fboiteux@free.fr> for the idea.
  * Point to console-data in the long description, like console-tools does.
  * Add ${misc:Depends}.

 -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Fri, 20 Feb 2009 17:52:16 +0100

kbd (1.14.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Read /etc/environment or /etc/default/locale earlier in the init script,
    closes: #486787.  This has caused UNICODE_MODE not to be set properly.
    Thanks to Stanislav Maslovski <stanislav.maslovski@gmail.com> for the
    patch.
  * Medium urgency upload because the former bug could have rendered kbd
    nearly useless for some.
  * unicode_start: Do not invoke setfont by default, closes: #443645.
  * Revert the console-screen.kbd.sh LSB header change from the previous
    revision, again closes: #483607.  Handling the original problem properly
    is considered insserv’s responsibility, see #474515.
  * openvt: Document the -f switch, closes: #487390.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes needed).

 -- Michael Schutte <m.schutte.jr@gmail.com>  Sun, 22 Jun 2008 12:45:38 +0200

kbd (1.14.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the LSB header of /etc/init.d/console-screen.kbd.sh to provide the
    unique name console-screen.kbd, closes: #483607.  This avoids collisions
    when replacing console-tools with kbd (and vice versa).
  * Remove MIA developer Denis Barbier from Uploaders, closes: #480167.
  * Set /sys/module/vt/parameters/default_utf8 at bootup, closes: #478480.
    This enables openvt’ing consoles in Unicode mode depending on the system
    locale.
  * Don’t say “Setting console screen modes and fonts” when not setting fonts,
    to avoid confusing people.

 -- Michael Schutte <m.schutte.jr@gmail.com>  Fri, 30 May 2008 16:04:24 +0200

kbd (1.14.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initialize all consoles in console-screen.kbd.sh, not only the first one;
    closes: #443606.  This partially reverts a change done in 1.12-15 (see the
    third changelog entry for that version).
  * Adjust LSB headers of init script to update-rc.d params, closes: #476097.
  * debian/console-screen.kbd.sh: Don’t set fonts and keymaps if setupcon is
    present.  console-setup will run right afterwards, anyway.
  * Create symlinks for loadkeys and dumpkeys in /usr/bin for better
    compatibility with console-tools.  See #261801.

kbd (1.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge changes from non-maintainer upload by Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt,
    closes: #459156.
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed now unnecessary build-dependencies on flex and bison.
  * Added myself to uploaders, closes: #446030
  * Remove debian/patches directory and build dependency on quilt.  Package
    maintenance now happens in a Git repository.
  * Make openvt pay attention to its child’s exit status.  Patch by Jim Paris,
    closes: #190386.
  * Avoid openvt messing up the child’s I/O caused by closing a standard file
    descriptor.  Patch by Jim Paris, closes: #190385.
  * Handle the CapsShift modifier understood by Linux kernels since 2.6.24.
    Patch by Samuel Thibault, closes: #452103.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Move dumpkeys and unicode_start to /bin.  This avoids problems when /usr
    is not yet mounted when /etc/init.d/keymap.sh (package console-common) is
    executed.  Thanks to Christian Perrier, Denis Barbier and others,
    closes: #261801.
  * Make upstream makefile not strip binaries to enable the nostrip build
    option, closes: #437248.
  * The Debian copyright file is now available in machine-readable format.
    The passage about kbd’s history was removed from it; upstream’s CREDITS
    file is shipped instead, as it includes the same information.
  * Added Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control.

kbd (1.12-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add me to uploaders
  * Add console-setup as an alternative in the dependencies on
    console-common and console-data.  Thanks to Martin-Éric Racine,
    closes: #398439.
  * Search for an installed font in unicode_start since now LatArCyrHeb-16
    may not be installed.
  * Some changes in /etc/init.d/console_screen.kbd.sh:
    - run unicode_{start,stop} before setfont.  Give a font argument to
      unicode_start so the font doesn't change twice. Thanks to Mattia,
      closes: #421390;
    - fix the per-VC font load;
    - (re)enable the per-VC ACM load;
    - for consistency use CONSOLE_MAP_vcN instead of APP_CHARSET_MAP_vcN
      and FONT_MAP_vcN instead of CONSOLE_MAP_vcN;
    - support also the config variables in console-tools style
      (APP_CHARSET_MAP, SCREEN_FONT, SCREEN_FONT_MAP);
    - do not run unicode_start if CONSOLE_MAP (or CONSOLE_MAP_vcN) is defined;
    - run unicode_start/unicode_stop only on consoles where we load a font;
    - do not use static paths such as /usr/bin/setfont;
    - add description and short description in the LSB header.
  * Use more substantial example for /etc/kbd/config based on the config
    file of console-tools.  Thanks to Jonny, closes: #410553.
  * Install kbd_mode and setfont in /bin rather than in /usr/bin so the
    administrator be able to set up the font in case of emergency and use
    the keyboard in utf-8 mode.
  * Add an udeb with loadkeys and kbd_mode.  A patch was provided by Frans
    Pop and was modified to give a -Os option to the compiler.

kbd (1.12-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/getfd.diff: New patch, the getfd function now tries to
    open /proc/self/fd/0, so that kbd_mode can be used to query or modify any
    TTY by running kbd_mode < /dev/ttyN.

  * debian/console-screen.kbd.sh: Fix LSB runtime info, as reported in #361051.

  * debian/console-screen.kbd.sh: When this script is run, only the first TTY
    is created, so all other TTYs have no settings.  A workaround is to add
      u8:23:once:/etc/init.d/console-screen.kbd.sh reload
    in /etc/inittab so that this script is run again after TTYs are allocated.
    If console detection does not work as expected, LIST_CONSOLES can be set
    in /etc/kbd/config, it contains a space seperated list of TTY numbers to
    be modified by this script.  WARNING: this is still experimental!

  * debian/patches/mapscrn-acm.diff: Let mapscrn also read ACM files, since

  * debian/patches/read_keymaps_fmt.diff: Let add_number() return its

kbd (1.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/30_kbdrate_sparc.dpatch:  Fix compilation on sparc,
    the kbd_repeat struct has no 'period' member.
  * debian/patches/20_showconsolefont.dpatch:  Renamed into
    debian/patches/20_main_argc.dpatch and fix more programs.
  * debian/patches/10_uni_suffix.dpatch:  console-data puts sfm files
    into /usr/share/consoletrans, so kbd has to look into this directory
    instead of /usr/share/unimaps.
  * debian/patches/90_read_keymaps_fmt.dpatch:  Minor changes.

kbd (1.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * kbd 1.12-2 did not reach archives, so changes are generated with
    -v1.12-1 flag.
  * debian/patches:  Rename patches:
           01loadkeys           -> 10_kmap_suffix
           02paths              -> 10_defkeymap

           10charsets0          -> 50_charsets0
  * debian/patches/90_read_keymaps_fmt.dpatch:
    This patch is reorganized, mostly in src/ksyms.c; the prefer_unicode
    variable is resurrected to replace ioctl calls.  This means that
    src/getfd.c does no more need to be patched, and -u flag is active
    again.

  * debian/patches/07showconsolefont.dpatch:
    showconsolefont choke on -C flag.
  * debian/patches/08loadkeys.dpatch:
    Apply patches sent to #251550 so that loadkeys sets keuboard maps
    depending on current mode and not on the format used to write keymap
    files.
  * debian/patches/09canonicalsyms.dpatch:  
    Different symbolic names are used for the same Unicode character,
    which may confuse loadkeys (see #260758).
  * debian/patches/10charsets0.dpatch:
    In order to find the right symbol name even when some symbols have
    several different names, charsets[0] stores code<->name mapping for the
    current charset.

kbd (1.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer, approved by Wartan Hachaturow.
  * debian/control: flex-old is an alternative for flex in Build-Depends.
  * debian/control: debian/rules uses debhelper 4. so build-depend on it.
  * debian/control: Fix package description to make lintian happy.
    Also remove mentions of openvt and kbdrate, these programs are part of
    kbd for a very long time.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version: 3.6.1, no changes needed in
    packaging.
  * debian/README.Debian: Remove the notice about showfont, it has been
    renamed upstream into showconsolefont.
  * debian/rules: Build and install contrib/codepage, contrib/vcstime,
    src/screendump, src/setlogcons and src/setvesablank programs.
  * debian/rules: Install programs to the same location as in console-tools,
    in particular fgconsole is moved from /usr/bin/fgconsole to
    /bin/fgconsole.
  * debian/patches/04pomakefile.dpatch:
    po/Makefile was patched instead of po/Makefile.in in original tarball.
  * debian/patches/05manpages.dpatch:
    These programs are installed, so copy their manual pages too:
       man/man1misc/codepage.1 man/man1misc/screendump.1
       man/man8misc/mk_modmap.8 man/man8misc/setvesablank.8
    Steal setlogcons.8, splitfont.1 and vcstime.8 from console-tools.
    Closes: #200106
    All programs shipped by kbd are now documented, so closes: #9697
    as well.  Thanks Alastair McKinstry for writing this documentation.
  * debian/patches/06kbdrate.dpatch:
    Kbdrate must not fail when not connected to a TTY.
    Closes: #212770  Thanks Frederic Gaus for the bugreport and its fix.
  * debian/console-screen.kbd.sh: $0 argument was tested instead of $1,
    and thus setfont was called in prerm, which may prevent kbd removal
    if setfont fails for any reason.  The console-screen.sh script from
    console-tools is much more complete, so replace its content by this
    script, with some changes.
  * debian/kbd.postinst: Since kbd depends on console-data and does not
    ship keymap files, its postinst must not run install-keymap.
    Having a more robust console-screen.kbd.sh script and kbd.postinst
    no longer running setfont makes upgrades and removals much smoother.
    Closes: #102074, #208767, #212325
  * debian/kbd.postrm: Configuration files are automatically removed on
    purge, so this file is useless.
  * debian/changelog: Remove Emacs settings.
  * debian/copyright: Add a link to GPL text.
  * Lintian now only reports no-manpage-in-correct-directory warnings,
    but program locations must be checked with console-tools maintainer.

    includes:
    - comment out debconf stuff in postinst and preinst.
  * templates file was not installed !  Added a commented out line in

    the diagnostic.
  * Added a comment note in kbdconfig about the need this script has for a
    data package to be installed when it is ran.
  * Get rid of old kludges in favor of clean and readable syntax for some
    tests in kbdconfig.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.0.1.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Oct 1999 23:33:09 +0200

kbd (0.99-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added .trans to "screen maps" (Font-to-Screen Maps, aka FCM) suffix

  * Moved config conffile into debian/conffiles.d/ to avoid name conflict
    with debconf support in debhelper.
  * Moved /usr/doc to /usr/share.
  * Removed postinst fixups of pre-hamm unstable breakages.
  * Removed predends support check from preinst.
  * Do not install spawn_* any more.

  * Conflict with kbd-data (kbdconfig now ignores the .map suffix).
  * Added missing quotes around shell wildcards in kbdconfig (Closes:

  * Made /etc/init.d/console-screen.kbd.sh do nothing when called with
    "stop" as parameter.
  * Removed my dh_installinit as new one includes needed feature.

  * Added back many data files from 0.96-a not yet forwarded upstream 
    (seems like I forgot about quite a lot of them !)
  * Fixed i386/include/euro.map to use AltGr, not Alt.
  * Do not install M$-word (yes !) file n474.doc.
  * Upstream now names .psf files with unicode table .psfu files.  This
    has no technical ground, and will break installs where people
    specified the full name for a font file.  Thus we install them as .psf
    like we always did.
  * Replaces: open instead of Suggesting: it because openvt is now part

  * Install .desc files in the correct locations, so that kbdconfig gives
    meaningfull messages when navigating the keymaps tree (discovered when
    reading report for Bug#32338 ;).
  * Fixed kbdconfig not to remove the just-created empty default.map so
    that it really knows on upgrades when the admin already told that no
    keymap should be loaded (discovered when looking for Bug#32338).
  * Do not run "loadkeys -d" in kbdconfig when a user tells that no keymap
    should be loaded.  Print a message instead saying that if there is
    already a keymap loaded, it cannot be unloaded (Fixes: Bug#32338).

    is deleted on reboot/halt to cope with changes in the builtin
    keymap.  Documented this behavour in README.Debian.
